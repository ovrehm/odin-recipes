        <!-- Description -->
        <p>This chili recipe is from my dad. Growing up, I went with my family to more chili cookoffs than I can count because of him, and I guess I still love chili because I make it every year without fail. It's hearty, easy to reheat in the microwave, and gets better over time. In my humble opinion, there's nothing better than sitting down to a hearty bowl of chili with all your favorite toppings and watching the Sunday game with family while snow is coming down outside. </p>

        <h2>Side Dish Ideas</h2>
        <p>Growing up with in an Asian household, I can confidently say I've had a bowl of chili with white rice and thought, for way longer than I'd like to admit, that everybody did this. White rice is a comfort food for me but southwest rice would be even better.</p>

            <li>Tator tots</li>
